Probability:

1. You have a 64% chance of getting a parking ticket in an hour after your meter expires.
How likely are you to get a ticket in a half an hour? Two hours?

2. You have a six sided die, but you need a seven sided die. How can you create D<sub>i</sub> from D<sub>j</sub>

3. The birthday problem - how many people do you need in a room to have it more likely than not that two are born on the same day of the year

Experiment Evaluation:

1. Version A of an advertisement is seen by  A<sub>n</sub> viewers and  A<sub>k</sub> click through, and version B is seen by  B<sub>m</sub> viewers and has  B<sub>l</sub> click through.
How do you compare them. What techniques can you use. What considerations do you need to make, what issues might there be in this dataset

2. Your PM went and built 5 different versions and wants to test all of them. What techniques are available do this. Choose and discuss trade offs between them
