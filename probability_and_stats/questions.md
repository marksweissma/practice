Experiment Evaluation:

1. Version A of an advertisement sees A<sub>n</sub> and  A<sub>k</sub> clicks, andn version B sees B<sub>m</sub> and  B<sub>l</sub> clicks.
How do you compare them. What techniques can you use. What considerations do you need to make, what issues might there be in this dataset

2. Your PM went and built 5 different versions and wants to test all of them. What techniques are available do this. Choose and discuss trade offs between them them
