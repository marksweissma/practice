Create an end to end notebook for the housing prices dataset. The goal is 
to build a model that will predict the current value of any new house that is seen in the same market
as the dataset covers. Your goal is to show me your process how you look and think about a new dataset.
How the data and application of your model impact your choices, what shortcuts they may allow you to take it and what you may not be able to accomplish that someone (like a PM, may think you could). What other analysis or future projects could this type of work support (how could seconday aspects of this support a business)

You cannot use donatello. I do not care about the final scores of the model. I do care (alot) about what evaluation metrics you chose, what they mean, and why you chose them.
